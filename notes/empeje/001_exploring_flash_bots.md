# Summary

This is the first start of my research on the Flashbots, Ethereum stability and the MEV.

Here are interesting idea I have found
* [Flashbots](https://github.com/flashbots) is a project that Vitalik Buterin considered as the best reply to the MEV problem.
* Flashbots approach is to increase the access to the arbitrage opportunity initially using a tool like MEV inspect, which now has two versions
    * [mev-inspect-rs](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-inspect-rs)
    * [mev-inspect-py](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-inspect-py)

I have found this interesting list of article as well:
* [MEV Research](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research/blob/main/resources.md)

Other than that now the access to create a Flashloan where we can use arbitrage opportunity and use other's people money is more accessible using the following tools
* AAVE for example provide a native way to create [flashloan](https://docs.aave.com/faq/flash-loans).
* Furucombo has a ready to use GUI tool to create a flashloan bundle. You can try the tools [here](https://furucombo.app/combo).
